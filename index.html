    <h1>JEDI</h1>
    <h2>Cat "Bars"</h2>
    <p>
      Bars is the true king of his domain. With his luxurious fur, reminiscent
      of a snow leopard, and a piercing gaze that can instantly stop anyone who
      dares to enter his territory, he commands respect. Bars loves spending
      time on the windowsill, watching the world outside, as if he's guarding
      his kingdom. His favorite activity is quietly observing everything around
      him, but when he's in the mood, he can be playful and affectionate,
      reminding everyone that even kings need some fun.
